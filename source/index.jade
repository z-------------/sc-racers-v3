                        I have always loved the idea of engineering and recently I have dreamed of placing that skill into motor sports. I work closely with all team members equally to ensure all tasks are carried out to full innovation. I am always available to help with any task required on our team.

                        I have always been interested in engineering and racing cars. My family has a history in the area of engineering and this influenced me into taking the same path. I also watch many races, mainly F1 and I saw this competition as an option to chase my ambitions.

                        I have always been interested in graphic design, from identifying fonts on road signs to creating innovative icons. I am fluent at using software such as Adobe Illustrator to create appealing and minimal graphics for the team in order to build a reputation of modernness and professionalism.

                        F1 in Schools is an international competition set out to provide an amazing but very challenging educational experience through the magnetic appeal of Formula One. The competition is the only global multi-disciplinary challenge for students aged 9-19 and is now recognised as the world's largest STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) competition.
                    p.
                        Students work in teams of between 3 and 6, each taking on an assigned role that fulfils the necessary components of the competition.

                        We are going to compete in the F1 in Schools National Finals in Hong Kong, and we need to raise funds in order to compete and succeed.
                    p.
                        The competition will involve (among other things) acquiring resources and equipment that we need to achieve our goal.
                    p Some of the things that need to be funded:
                    ul
                        li car resources and materials
                        li team display
                        li uniform
                    p.
                        We would be very grateful if you would consider sponsoring us, six students from Hong Kong, and help us to succeed in our quest for success in F1 in Schools.
